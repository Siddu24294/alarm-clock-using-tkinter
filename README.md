# alarm-clock-using-tkinter
This is an alarm clock made in python using tkinkter for gui, winsound for playing the alarm sound and time for comparing the correct time for the alarm to ring.
Curently it can only run one alarm at once.
In future I am thinking about a multialarm fucntionality as well as to optimse it so that it uses less memory in  the backgroud.
